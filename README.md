# Network Traffic Flow Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on building a **machine learning-based network traffic classification model** to distinguish between normal and malicious network activities. By analyzing network flow features, the model aims to **improve intrusion detection accuracy, reduce false positives**, and strengthen overall network security.

The workflow includes **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation** using various ML algorithms.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source:** [Specify dataset source, e.g., CICIDS, KDD Cup, custom network capture]
- **Type:** Network traffic flow records
- **Features:**  
  - Flow statistics (duration, packet counts, byte counts, etc.)  
  - Protocol-specific details (TCP, UDP, etc.)  
  - Flags and flow indicators  
- **Target Variable:**  
  - Attack Type / Normal

## ðŸ§  Model & Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling.
2. **EDA** â€“ Visualizing class distribution, correlations, feature importance.
3. **Model Training** â€“ Tested algorithms such as:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting / XGBoost
4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC Curve
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Achieved **[Insert Accuracy]% accuracy** on the test set.
- High detection rate for most attack types.
- Reduced false positives compared to baseline methods.

Example Visualizations:
- Feature Importance Plot
- Class Distribution Graph
